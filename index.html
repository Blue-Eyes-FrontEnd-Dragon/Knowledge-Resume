                    <p>
                        I began my programming journey in 2015 whilst working at the Citizens Advice Bureau.
                        During my down-time as a Technical Support Engineer I began reading books and studying
                        the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

                        My boss' at this time were very supportive and allowed me to join on to a project
                        with their sister company MINTED to revamp the front-end of their website using
                        modern techniques.

                        On this year I also attained a place at Huddersfield University for Software Engineering.

                    <p>
                        During this time I had undertaken my first term at University, 
                        learning the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming in 
                        Java.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my second year of University I undertook projects using C++ to create
                        a BlackBox based application, simulating flight data. I also worked on a System Information
                        and Event Management application in C# for the Cyber-Security module. I also began
                        my journey into Game Development building some basic games.

                    <p>
                        During my third year at University I worked with PHP and SQL,
                        building more advanced database based applications, along with
                        a basic PHP MVC framework.

                    <p>
                        In this year I undertook an Artificial Intelligence module, in which 
                        I worked in MatLab and Python to build sat-solvers and intelligent
                        problem solutions. Along with this I also partook in an Advanced Web
                        module in which I worked to build a Laravel social application aimed
                        at inventors.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"> 2020: Laravel 8, Postgres, Docker, RDF, & Prolog </i></h3>
                    <p>
                        During my final year I worked with Prolog during another Artificial Intelligence 
                        module to model a traffic system. I also partook in a Machine Learning module
                        which enhanced my experience with Python further. During this time I also
                        worked on Semantic Web technologies using Protege and RDF to define a 
                        Universe ontology to describe the Universe at a Galactic scale. 

                        In this year I also attained my first full-time professional role as 
                        a Software Engineer at Connex One whilst also volunteering at DDR-Digital 
                        in my spare time. From this I learned new technologies including Laravel 8, 
                        Docker, and Postgres.

                    <p>
                        Over the course of 2021 I have began branching out into more technologies.
                        In doing so I branched into using Node servers to build microservices, 
                        and React.js to build component based Front-Ends.
